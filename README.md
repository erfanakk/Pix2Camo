# Camouflage Object Segmentation with Attention-Guided Pix2Pix and Boundary Awareness

This repository contains the implementation of models presented in the paper **"Camouflage Object Segmentation with Attention-Guided Pix2Pix and Boundary Awareness."** The focus of this paper is on developing advanced models for the segmentation of camouflaged objects using a modified Pix2Pix architecture.

## Models

### 1. Discriminator

The `Discriminator` model is designed to distinguish between real and generated segmentation maps. It employs a PatchGAN architecture, evaluating local patches instead of the entire image. This enables more precise discrimination, particularly useful in handling high-frequency details.


### 2. Generator

The `Generator` model utilizes a Pix2Pix framework augmented with a VGG16 backbone for robust feature extraction. Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAMs) are integrated to enhance focus on critical details during the segmentation process.
